1;Romance Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance;Falling in love and struggling to progress towards—or maintain—a romantic relationship take priority, while other subplots either take backseat or are designed to develop the main love story. The narrative focuses on the thoughts and emotions of the characters, illustrating the connections between them and explaining their reactions to events or conflict. Almost always, the story ends happily and the couple is rewarded for their efforts with lasting love.  Romance stories require significant romantic development leading to some kind of conclusion: either to begin the relationship, continue it, or end it. Open-ended romantic endings are only acceptable when the work is an incomplete adaptation of a Romance source. "Teasing" stories which do not narrate significant romantic development but have a conclusion should be tagged Romantic Subplot.  A story can be simply Romance. Since they are plot-driven stories showing humans experiencing romantic struggle, most Romance has some Drama inherently. For both tags, the drama should be focused not only on the relationship but also on the side storylines; for example, one character overcoming the death of a loved one or a drug addiction. Comedy requires Romance narratives to be focused on eliciting laughter, not only using comedy for lightheartedness. Slice of Life and Romance are incompatible by definition.;2036

9;Romantic Subtext Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/74/Romantic_Subtext;Romantic Subtext is a narrative which can at first appear to be Romance. These plots feature one or more main couples which seem to have romantic interest in each other, and whose relationship(s) will be central to the main story. However, while the story will set the couple up for heartwarming or embarrassing moments, these encounters will not lead to any significant romantic development, and the characters will not strive to deepen the relationship beyond a certain boundary.  Some early indicators of Romantic Subtext include a missing emotional throughline (lack of personal reflection which allows the characters to understand their feelings and share these with the audience) and a lack of any conflict which will deepen or drive the relationship apart. Almost always, Romantic Subtext is a theme under the Comedy genre and these stories have plots designed to uplift the audience with positive emotion or amusement.  Not to be confused with Romantic Sideplot, where a Romance narrative is side story to another main genre plot (e.g. Action or Adventure). Romance and Romantic Subtext are mutually exclusive by definition. Harem and Reverse Harem may fall into a similar pattern of absent romantic development, but will not be double-tagged.;53

13;Supernatural Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural;Primarily taking place on Earth, supernatural stories incorporate elements or attributes that are unnatural and unexplainable by science. Creatures common in folklore (ghosts, vampires) or humans with metaphysical powers (telekinesis, mind reading) are often featured.  Character traits (e.g. demon/spirit) and setting alone do not determine if a story is Supernatural. If only a few characters have powers and most of the cast would be in disbelief to discover this (e.g. one man is an exorcist and the rest are normal adults), then the story is Supernatural. If majority of the cast has magical or supernatural powers (e.g. one normal highschool boy surrounded by five goddesses), then the story is Fantasy. Sometimes a story can be both Supernatural and Fantasy, but this is rare.  When searching for stories featuring creatures, spirits, or gods from folklore, the Mythology and Vampire themes can help refine your search. For superhero stories, please refer to Mahou Shoujo or Superpower.;1487

The term Boys Love and its abbreviation BL are commonly used to refer media written by women for female audiences in Japan, while the term Bara is often used for media written by men for male audiences. In the West, the terms Shounen Ai (romantic/non-sexual) and Yaoi (sexual) are more commonly used for BL.  On MAL, Boys Love combines all homosexual relationships between men and explicit genres (Ecchi, Erotica, Hentai) are used to indicate the sexual content level. This means most Shounen Ai stories have no explicit genres, most Yaoi are labelled Ecchi or Erotica, and most Bara are labelled Hentai.;171

30;Showbiz Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/75/Showbiz;Show business, or Showbiz for short, describes the industry which produces popular entertainment media such as television shows, movies, radio programs, magazines, and mainstream contemporary music. One or main characters in Showbiz themed stories work in the entertainment industry, either as a performer (e.g. actress, model) or in business development (e.g. manager, producer). Their occupation should also be central to the main story's plotline. For example, simply dating a famous band member but never seeing that character perform or struggle with their profession is not Showbiz.  Idols-themed stories are a subcategory of Showbiz, so they are not double-tagged with Idols (female) or Idols (male). Stories featuring a main cast of both female and male idols equally is rare, so those will be have the Showbiz theme.;36

42;Supernatural Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural;Primarily taking place on Earth, supernatural stories incorporate elements or attributes that are unnatural and unexplainable by science. Creatures common in folklore (ghosts, vampires) or humans with metaphysical powers (telekinesis, mind reading) are often featured.  Character traits (e.g. demon/spirit) and setting alone do not determine if a story is Supernatural. If only a few characters have powers and most of the cast would be in disbelief to discover this (e.g. one man is an exorcist and the rest are normal adults), then the story is Supernatural. If majority of the cast has magical or supernatural powers (e.g. one normal highschool boy surrounded by five goddesses), then the story is Fantasy. Sometimes a story can be both Supernatural and Fantasy, but this is rare.  When searching for stories featuring creatures, spirits, or gods from folklore, the Mythology and Vampire themes can help refine your search. For superhero stories, please refer to Mahou Shoujo or Superpower.;1487

43;Slice of Life Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life;Slice of Life stories are focused on a seemingly random and mundane period of the main characters' lives. The absence of a central plot to carry the story towards a charted destination means Slice of Life stories frequently lack overarching conflict and resolution. While life is not without conflict and Slice of Life neither, here conflict appears and dissipates seemingly at will, without a specific narrative to enforce it.  Slow story pacing or episodic storytelling does not equal Slice of Life. Drama/Romance stories can be slow and soft while maintaining a central plot of human/relationship struggle. Comedy stories may lack progress and have mundane settings, but they have narratives focused on eliciting laughter rather than amusing moments happening naturally. Thus, Slice of Life is incompatible with Comedy, Drama, and Romance by definition.;1637

Open-ended romantic endings are only acceptable when the work is an incomplete adaptation of a Romance source. "Teasing" stories which do not narrate significant romantic development but have a conclusion should be tagged Romantic Subplot.  A story can be simply Romance. Since they are plot-driven stories showing humans experiencing romantic struggle, most Romance has some Drama inherently. For both tags, the drama should be focused not only on the relationship but also on the side storylines; for example, one character overcoming the death of a loved one or a drug addiction. Comedy requires Romance narratives to be focused on eliciting laughter, not only using comedy for lightheartedness. Slice of Life and Romance are incompatible by definition.;2036
46;Supernatural Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural;Primarily taking place on Earth, supernatural stories incorporate elements or attributes that are unnatural and unexplainable by science. Creatures common in folklore (ghosts, vampires) or humans with metaphysical powers (telekinesis, mind reading) are often featured.  Character traits (e.g. demon/spirit) and setting alone do not determine if a story is Supernatural. If only a few characters have powers and most of the cast would be in disbelief to discover this (e.g. one man is an exorcist and the rest are normal adults), then the story is Supernatural. If majority of the cast has magical or supernatural powers (e.g. one normal highschool boy surrounded by five goddesses), then the story is Fantasy. Sometimes a story can be both Supernatural and Fantasy, but this is rare.  When searching for stories featuring creatures, spirits, or gods from folklore, the Mythology and Vampire themes can help refine your search. For superhero stories, please refer to Mahou Shoujo or Superpower.;1487

65;Supernatural Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural;Primarily taking place on Earth, supernatural stories incorporate elements or attributes that are unnatural and unexplainable by science. Creatures common in folklore (ghosts, vampires) or humans with metaphysical powers (telekinesis, mind reading) are often featured.  Character traits (e.g. demon/spirit) and setting alone do not determine if a story is Supernatural. If only a few characters have powers and most of the cast would be in disbelief to discover this (e.g. one man is an exorcist and the rest are normal adults), then the story is Supernatural. If majority of the cast has magical or supernatural powers (e.g. one normal highschool boy surrounded by five goddesses), then the story is Fantasy. Sometimes a story can be both Supernatural and Fantasy, but this is rare.  When searching for stories featuring creatures, spirits, or gods from folklore, the Mythology and Vampire themes can help refine your search. For superhero stories, please refer to Mahou Shoujo or Superpower.;1487

66;Boys Love Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/28/Boys_Love;Same-sex romantic/sexual relationships between men are the focus of these stories.  The term Boys Love and its abbreviation BL are commonly used to refer media written by women for female audiences in Japan, while the term Bara is often used for media written by men for male audiences. In the West, the terms Shounen Ai (romantic/non-sexual) and Yaoi (sexual) are more commonly used for BL.  On MAL, Boys Love combines all homosexual relationships between men and explicit genres (Ecchi, Erotica, Hentai) are used to indicate the sexual content level. This means most Shounen Ai stories have no explicit genres, most Yaoi are labelled Ecchi or Erotica, and most Bara are labelled Hentai.;171

67;Slice of Life Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life;Slice of Life stories are focused on a seemingly random and mundane period of the main characters' lives. The absence of a central plot to carry the story towards a charted destination means Slice of Life stories frequently lack overarching conflict and resolution. While life is not without conflict and Slice of Life neither, here conflict appears and dissipates seemingly at will, without a specific narrative to enforce it.  Slow story pacing or episodic storytelling does not equal Slice of Life. Drama/Romance stories can be slow and soft while maintaining a central plot of human/relationship struggle. Comedy stories may lack progress and have mundane settings, but they have narratives focused on eliciting laughter rather than amusing moments happening naturally. Thus, Slice of Life is incompatible with Comedy, Drama, and Romance by definition.;1637

The narrative of science fiction (Sci-Fi or SF) stories focuses on the societal or individual reprecussions caused by the imagined technology or natural phenomenon, and are frequently dystopian in nature.  Sufficient world-building is required for a work to be Sci-Fi; an alien simply visiting from outer space and living on Earth with unusual powers would be Supernatural. Characters in Sci-Fi stories can have unnatural powers without a Fantasy/Supernatural tag, but there should be a plausible scientific reason for these powers described by the creator.

84;Otaku Culture Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture;Otaku is a term in used in modern Japan to refer to people with obsessive interests. Outside of Japan, it specifically denotes people who have a heavy interest in anime, manga, and other Japanese culture or entertainment. Otaku Culture themed stories have a plot which is related to the hobbies or occupation of a main cast who are heavily involved in anime-related media. Characters could be creating anime or manga (professionally or casually with friends), attending conventions or idol concerts, dressing up in cosplay, etc.  Please note stories focusing on seiyuu (voice acting) fall under the Showbiz theme due to their celebrity status.;92

85;Comedy Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy;Uplifting the audience with positive emotion takes priority, eliciting laughter, amusement, or general entertainment. Almost always, comedy stories are episodic or have happy endings.  Nearly every work will use comedy as a plot device to relieve tension, but the overarching narrative must be focused on evoking amusement to be Comedy. Drama and Comedy are not mutually exclusive, but mixing them requires the audience facing human struggle with lightheartedness. Slice of Life and Comedy are incompatible by definition.;7175

87;Slice of Life Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life;Slice of Life stories are focused on a seemingly random and mundane period of the main characters' lives. The absence of a central plot to carry the story towards a charted destination means Slice of Life stories frequently lack overarching conflict and resolution. While life is not without conflict and Slice of Life neither, here conflict appears and dissipates seemingly at will, without a specific narrative to enforce it.  Slow story pacing or episodic storytelling does not equal Slice of Life. Drama/Romance stories can be slow and soft while maintaining a central plot of human/relationship struggle. Comedy stories may lack progress and have mundane settings, but they have narratives focused on eliciting laughter rather than amusing moments happening naturally. Thus, Slice of Life is incompatible with Comedy, Drama, and Romance by definition.;1637

88;Drama Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama;Plot-driven stories focused on realistic characters experiencing human struggle.

92;Action Anime;https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action;Exciting action sequences take priority and significant conflicts between characters are usually resolved with one's physical power. While the overarching plot may involve one group against another, the narrative in action stories is always focused on the strengths/weaknesses of individual characters and the effort they put into their personal battles with the opposing group's members.  Contrast with Military or Sports where the narrative is on collective achievement, or monster-of-the-week where the brief action scenes are a predicted climax to the episode's plot.;4967
