"18","Detective Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective","A theme within the Mystery genre, these stories feature either a detective or amateur investigator working to solve a crime or puzzling event. To classify as Detective, the character must either by employed as an investigator (e.g. police officer, private detective) or be sought out by enforcement/clients because of their case-solving reputation (e.g. Sherlock). If the character only seeks out mysteries as a hobby or becomes embroiled in them randomly, then the Detective theme does not apply. Anti-heroes being pursued by enforcement is not Detective.","302"

"25","Comedy Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy","Uplifting the audience with positive emotion takes priority, eliciting laughter, amusement, or general entertainment. Almost always, comedy stories are episodic or have happy endings.  Nearly every work will use comedy as a plot device to relieve tension, but the overarching narrative must be focused on evoking amusement to be Comedy. Drama and Comedy are not mutually exclusive, but mixing them requires the audience facing human struggle with lightheartedness. Slice of Life and Comedy are incompatible by definition.","7191"
"26","Supernatural Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural","Primarily taking place on Earth, supernatural stories incorporate elements or attributes that are unnatural and unexplainable by science. Creatures common in folklore (ghosts, vampires) or humans with metaphysical powers (telekinesis, mind reading) are often featured.  Character traits (e.g. demon/spirit) and setting alone do not determine if a story is Supernatural. If only a few characters have powers and most of the cast would be in disbelief to discover this (e.g. one man is an exorcist and the rest are normal adults), then the story is Supernatural. If majority of the cast has magical or supernatural powers (e.g. one normal highschool boy surrounded by five goddesses), then the story is Fantasy. Sometimes a story can be both Supernatural and Fantasy, but this is rare.  When searching for stories featuring creatures, spirits, or gods from folklore, the Mythology and Vampire themes can help refine your search. For superhero stories, please refer to Mahou Shoujo or Superpower.","1491"

"28","Fantasy Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy","Magical powers, unnatural creatures, or other unreal elements which cannot be explained by science are prevalent and normal to the setting they exist in. Fantasy stories can take place on Earth (urban fantasy) or in another world.  Character traits (e.g. magician vs demon/spirit) and setting do not determine if a story is Fantasy. If majority of the cast has magical or supernatural powers (e.g. one normal highschool boy surrounded by five goddesses), then the story is Fantasy. If only a few characters have powers and most of the cast would be in disbelief to discover this (e.g. one man is an exorcist and the rest are normal adults), then the story is Supernatural. Sometimes a story can be both Fantasy and Supernatural, but this is rare.  When searching for High Fantasy stories, excluding lower fantasy themes (e.g. Mythology, Superpower) can help refine your search.","5543"

"31","Hentai Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai","Descripcion generica","1501"
"32","Horror Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror","Creating—and maintaining—a sense of dread in the audience takes priority, eliciting shock, fear, or disgust through atmosphere and frightening scenarios. Mood must be of equal or greater importance than setting and characterization in horror stories. Almost always, the main cast will be under constant threat of danger.  Many stories can incorporate elements of horror as a plot device to unnerve the audience, but the overarching narrative must be focused on evoking and maintaining apprehension to be Horror. Contrast with Suspense where the audience craves to know what will happen next rather than fearing it.","544"

"35","Crossdressing Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/81/Crossdressing","One or more main characters in these stories identify as their biological sex, but routinely dress in a way that results in them being mistaken for the opposite sex. Since the act of crossdressing must be a central theme, often the main character is trying to hide their identity or achieve some goal. If the character simply enjoys crossdressing, the narrative should be focused on how the important people in the character's life react to or come to accept it.  One main character dressing as the opposite sex for reasons unrelated to the central plot is not Crossdressing.","48"
