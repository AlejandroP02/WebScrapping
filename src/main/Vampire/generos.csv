"1","Action Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action","Exciting action sequences take priority and significant conflicts between characters are usually resolved with one's physical power. While the overarching plot may involve one group against another, the narrative in action stories is always focused on the strengths/weaknesses of individual characters and the effort they put into their personal battles with the opposing group's members.  Contrast with Military or Sports where the narrative is on collective achievement, or monster-of-the-week where the brief action scenes are a predicted climax to the episode's plot.","5017"
"2","Adventure Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure","Whether aiming for a specific goal or just struggling to survive, the main character is thrust into unfamiliar situations or lands and continuously faces unexpected dangers. The narrative of adventure stories is always on how the characters react to sudden events or trials during the journey, indicating personal growth or setback based on which actions or choices are taken.  Character development as a response to the journey's dangers is a requirement of adventure stories. Simply experiencing foreign lands or worlds is not adventure.","3983"
"3","Supernatural Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural","Primarily taking place on Earth, supernatural stories incorporate elements or attributes that are unnatural and unexplainable by science. Creatures common in folklore (ghosts, vampires) or humans with metaphysical powers (telekinesis, mind reading) are often featured.  Character traits (e.g. demon/spirit) and setting alone do not determine if a story is Supernatural. If only a few characters have powers and most of the cast would be in disbelief to discover this (e.g. one man is an exorcist and the rest are normal adults), then the story is Supernatural. If majority of the cast has magical or supernatural powers (e.g. one normal highschool boy surrounded by five goddesses), then the story is Fantasy. Sometimes a story can be both Supernatural and Fantasy, but this is rare.  When searching for stories featuring creatures, spirits, or gods from folklore, the Mythology and Vampire themes can help refine your search. For superhero stories, please refer to Mahou Shoujo or Superpower.","1485"

"7","Mystery Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery","Whether its solving a crime or finding an explanation for a puzzling circumstance, the main cast willingly or reluctantly become investigators who must work to answer the who, what, why, and/or how of the current dilemma. The narrative of mystery stories is always on collecting evidence, identifying suspects, and theorizing possible scenarios for the unexplainable, before finally capturing the perpetrator or resolving the current situation.  Almost always, the audience has the same information as the main characters and anticipation is directed towards discovering the explanation, not what will transpire after the answer is found. Contrast with Suspense or Horror where often the audience has more information than the cast, which heightens the tension or fear of what will happen next.","890"
"8","Romance Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance","Falling in love and struggling to progress towards—or maintain—a romantic relationship take priority, while other subplots either take backseat or are designed to develop the main love story. The narrative focuses on the thoughts and emotions of the characters, illustrating the connections between them and explaining their reactions to events or conflict. Almost always, the story ends happily and the couple is rewarded for their efforts with lasting love.  Romance stories require significant romantic development leading to some kind of conclusion: either to begin the relationship, continue it, or end it. Open-ended romantic endings are only acceptable when the work is an incomplete adaptation of a Romance source. ""Teasing"" stories which do not narrate significant romantic development but have a conclusion should be tagged Romantic Subplot.  A story can be simply Romance. Since they are plot-driven stories showing humans experiencing romantic struggle, most Romance has some Drama inherently. For both tags, the drama should be focused not only on the relationship but also on the side storylines; for example, one character overcoming the death of a loved one or a drug addiction. Comedy requires Romance narratives to be focused on eliciting laughter, not only using comedy for lightheartedness. Slice of Life and Romance are incompatible by definition.","2034"
"9","Drama Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama","Plot-driven stories focused on realistic characters experiencing human struggle. Because drama stories ask the question of what it means to be human, the conflict and emotions will be relatable, even if the settings or characters themselves are not. Here, you will see humanity at its worst, its best, and everything in between.  Simply having a serious tone, dramatic moments, or evoking tears does not equal Drama. If the narrative focuses on eliciting emotional reactions rather than on characterization, then it is melodrama and not Drama. Slice of Life and Drama are incompatible by definition.","2907"
"10","Fantasy Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy","Magical powers, unnatural creatures, or other unreal elements which cannot be explained by science are prevalent and normal to the setting they exist in. Fantasy stories can take place on Earth (urban fantasy) or in another world.  Character traits (e.g. magician vs demon/spirit) and setting do not determine if a story is Fantasy. If majority of the cast has magical or supernatural powers (e.g. one normal highschool boy surrounded by five goddesses), then the story is Fantasy. If only a few characters have powers and most of the cast would be in disbelief to discover this (e.g. one man is an exorcist and the rest are normal adults), then the story is Supernatural. Sometimes a story can be both Fantasy and Supernatural, but this is rare.  When searching for High Fantasy stories, excluding lower fantasy themes (e.g. Mythology, Superpower) can help refine your search.","5608"

"12","Horror Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror","Creating—and maintaining—a sense of dread in the audience takes priority, eliciting shock, fear, or disgust through atmosphere and frightening scenarios. Mood must be of equal or greater importance than setting and characterization in horror stories. Almost always, the main cast will be under constant threat of danger.  Many stories can incorporate elements of horror as a plot device to unnerve the audience, but the overarching narrative must be focused on evoking and maintaining apprehension to be Horror. Contrast with Suspense where the audience craves to know what will happen next rather than fearing it.","547"

"17","Comedy Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy","Uplifting the audience with positive emotion takes priority, eliciting laughter, amusement, or general entertainment. Almost always, comedy stories are episodic or have happy endings.  Nearly every work will use comedy as a plot device to relieve tension, but the overarching narrative must be focused on evoking amusement to be Comedy. Drama and Comedy are not mutually exclusive, but mixing them requires the audience facing human struggle with lightheartedness. Slice of Life and Comedy are incompatible by definition.","7225"

"28","Sci-Fi Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi","Imagined technological advancements or natural settings which are currently unreal in the present day but could be invented, caused, or explained by science in the future. The narrative of science fiction (Sci-Fi or SF) stories focuses on the societal or individual reprecussions caused by the imagined technology or natural phenomenon, and are frequently dystopian in nature.  Sufficient world-building is required for a work to be Sci-Fi; an alien simply visiting from outer space and living on Earth with unusual powers would be Supernatural. Characters in Sci-Fi stories can have unnatural powers without a Fantasy/Supernatural tag, but there should be a plausible scientific reason for these powers described by the creator. A futuristic setting with impossible, unexplained powers (e.g. humans randomly evolved to control the weather via thought) would be Fantasy.","3218"
"29","Detective Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective","A theme within the Mystery genre, these stories feature either a detective or amateur investigator working to solve a crime or puzzling event. To classify as Detective, the character must either by employed as an investigator (e.g. police officer, private detective) or be sought out by enforcement/clients because of their case-solving reputation (e.g. Sherlock). If the character only seeks out mysteries as a hobby or becomes embroiled in them randomly, then the Detective theme does not apply. Anti-heroes being pursued by enforcement is not Detective.","310"

"37","Boys Love Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/28/Boys_Love","Same-sex romantic/sexual relationships between men are the focus of these stories.  The term Boys Love and its abbreviation BL are commonly used to refer media written by women for female audiences in Japan, while the term Bara is often used for media written by men for male audiences. In the West, the terms Shounen Ai (romantic/non-sexual) and Yaoi (sexual) are more commonly used for BL.  On MAL, Boys Love combines all homosexual relationships between men and explicit genres (Ecchi, Erotica, Hentai) are used to indicate the sexual content level. This means most Shounen Ai stories have no explicit genres, most Yaoi are labelled Ecchi or Erotica, and most Bara are labelled Hentai.","175"

Since the act of crossdressing must be a central theme, often the main character is trying to hide their identity or achieve some goal. If the character simply enjoys crossdressing, the narrative should be focused on how the important people in the character's life react to or come to accept it.  One main character dressing as the opposite sex for reasons unrelated to the central plot is not Crossdressing.","48"
