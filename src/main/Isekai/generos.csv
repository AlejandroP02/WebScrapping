"24","Otaku Culture Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture","Otaku is a term in used in modern Japan to refer to people with obsessive interests. Outside of Japan, it specifically denotes people who have a heavy interest in anime, manga, and other Japanese culture or entertainment. Otaku Culture themed stories have a plot which is related to the hobbies or occupation of a main cast who are heavily involved in anime-related media. Characters could be creating anime or manga (professionally or casually with friends), attending conventions or idol concerts, dressing up in cosplay, etc.  Please note stories focusing on seiyuu (voice acting) fall under the Showbiz theme due to their celebrity status.","92"
"25","Fantasy Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy","Magical powers, unnatural creatures, or other unreal elements which cannot be explained by science are prevalent and normal to the setting they exist in. Fantasy stories can take place on Earth (urban fantasy) or in another world.  Character traits (e.g. magician vs demon/spirit) and setting do not determine if a story is Fantasy. If majority of the cast has magical or supernatural powers (e.g. one normal highschool boy surrounded by five goddesses), then the story is Fantasy. If only a few characters have powers and most of the cast would be in disbelief to discover this (e.g. one man is an exorcist and the rest are normal adults), then the story is Supernatural. Sometimes a story can be both Fantasy and Supernatural, but this is rare.  When searching for High Fantasy stories, excluding lower fantasy themes (e.g. Mythology, Superpower) can help refine your search.","5543"

"29","Magical Sex Shift Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/65/Magical_Sex_Shift","One or more main characters in these stories identify as their biological sex, but their body is suddenly changed to the opposite sex through magical means. This Magical Sex Switch may be temporary, irreversible, or allow the character to change back and forth between the two. Since the character's original identity is not lost, coming to terms with the magical sex switch or finding a method to change back should play a central role in the plot.  Trading bodies between opposite sexes is Body Swap themed. Dying or being killed, and then being reborn as the opposite sex, is Reincarnation.","30"

"36","Comedy Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy","Uplifting the audience with positive emotion takes priority, eliciting laughter, amusement, or general entertainment. Almost always, comedy stories are episodic or have happy endings.  Nearly every work will use comedy as a plot device to relieve tension, but the overarching narrative must be focused on evoking amusement to be Comedy. Drama and Comedy are not mutually exclusive, but mixing them requires the audience facing human struggle with lightheartedness. Slice of Life and Comedy are incompatible by definition.","7191"
"37","Action Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action","Exciting action sequences take priority and significant conflicts between characters are usually resolved with one's physical power. While the overarching plot may involve one group against another, the narrative in action stories is always focused on the strengths/weaknesses of individual characters and the effort they put into their personal battles with the opposing group's members.  Contrast with Military or Sports where the narrative is on collective achievement, or monster-of-the-week where the brief action scenes are a predicted climax to the episode's plot.","4970"
"38","Adventure Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure","Whether aiming for a specific goal or just struggling to survive, the main character is thrust into unfamiliar situations or lands and continuously faces unexpected dangers. The narrative of adventure stories is always on how the characters react to sudden events or trials during the journey, indicating personal growth or setback based on which actions or choices are taken.  Character development as a response to the journey's dangers is a requirement of adventure stories. Simply experiencing foreign lands or worlds is not adventure.","3955"

"41","Romantic Subtext Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/74/Romantic_Subtext","Romantic Subtext is a narrative which can at first appear to be Romance. These plots feature one or more main couples which seem to have romantic interest in each other, and whose relationship(s) will be central to the main story. However, while the story will set the couple up for heartwarming or embarrassing moments, these encounters will not lead to any significant romantic development, and the characters will not strive to deepen the relationship beyond a certain boundary.  Some early indicators of Romantic Subtext include a missing emotional throughline (lack of personal reflection which allows the characters to understand their feelings and share these with the audience) and a lack of any conflict which will deepen or drive the relationship apart. Almost always, Romantic Subtext is a theme under the Comedy genre and these stories have plots designed to uplift the audience with positive emotion or amusement.  Not to be confused with Romantic Sideplot, where a Romance narrative is side story to another main genre plot (e.g. Action or Adventure). Romance and Romantic Subtext are mutually exclusive by definition. Harem and Reverse Harem may fall into a similar pattern of absent romantic development, but will not be double-tagged.","53"
