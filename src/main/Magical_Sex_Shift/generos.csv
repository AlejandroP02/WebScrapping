"2","Magical Sex Shift Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/65/Magical_Sex_Shift","One or more main characters in these stories identify as their biological sex, but their body is suddenly changed to the opposite sex through magical means. This Magical Sex Switch may be temporary, irreversible, or allow the character to change back and forth between the two. Since the character's original identity is not lost, coming to terms with the magical sex switch or finding a method to change back should play a central role in the plot.  Trading bodies between opposite sexes is Body Swap themed. Dying or being killed, and then being reborn as the opposite sex, is Reincarnation.","30"

"12","Comedy Anime","https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy","Uplifting the audience with positive emotion takes priority, eliciting laughter, amusement, or general entertainment. Almost always, comedy stories are episodic or have happy endings.  Nearly every work will use comedy as a plot device to relieve tension, but the overarching narrative must be focused on evoking amusement to be Comedy. Drama and Comedy are not mutually exclusive, but mixing them requires the audience facing human struggle with lightheartedness. Slice of Life and Comedy are incompatible by definition.","7191"
